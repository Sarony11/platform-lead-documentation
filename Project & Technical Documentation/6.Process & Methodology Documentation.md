## 6. Process & Methodology Documentation: Useful Documents

This category of documents defines *how* a team works, its operational processes, and the specific methodologies it follows. These are crucial for ensuring consistency, efficiency, and smooth collaboration within the team and across the organization.

1.  ### Team Working Agreements / Team Norms
    * **What it is:** A set of shared principles, guidelines, and rules that a team explicitly agrees upon for how they will work together. This includes aspects like communication protocols, meeting etiquette, conflict resolution approaches, and how they handle disagreements.
    * **Why it's useful:** These documents are fundamental for **establishing a healthy and effective team culture**. They proactively address potential sources of friction, ensure everyone understands expected behaviors, and empower the team to self-regulate and hold each other accountable to agreed-upon norms.

2.  ### Definition of Done (DoD)
    * **What it is:** A clear, collectively agreed-upon checklist of criteria that a Product Backlog Item (e.g., a user story, a bug fix) must satisfy to be considered "Done" and potentially shippable. This goes beyond just "code complete" and often includes criteria like code reviewed, tested (unit, integration, acceptance), deployed to a specific environment (e.g., staging), documentation updated, and acceptance criteria met.
    * **Why it's useful:** The DoD is **critical for ensuring consistent quality and transparency**. It eliminates ambiguity about what "finished" means, drives the team towards a high standard of work, and provides a clear checkpoint before work moves forward, preventing technical debt and rework.

3.  ### Definition of Ready (DoR)
    * **What it is:** A clear, collectively agreed-upon checklist of criteria that a Product Backlog Item must meet *before* the development team can pull it into a sprint or start working on it. This typically includes criteria like the story being clear, estimated, dependencies identified, and acceptance criteria defined.
    * **Why it's useful:** The DoR ensures that the team starts work on items that are **well-understood and actionable**. It prevents work from being blocked by unclear requirements or missing information, making planning more efficient and reducing mid-sprint interruptions.

4.  ### Internal Agile Playbooks / Scrum Guides
    * **What it is:** Customized guides that detail how a specific organization or team implements Agile, Scrum, Kanban, or other methodologies. It clarifies specific roles, ceremonies, artifacts, and tools used within their unique context, often adapting general frameworks to fit their needs.
    * **Why it's useful:** These provide **consistency and clarity in process adoption** across multiple teams or for new hires. They bridge the gap between theoretical agile principles and the practical, day-to-day execution within a given company, ensuring everyone understands "how we do Agile here."

5.  ### Onboarding Checklists (Process-specific)
    * **What it is:** Checklists designed to guide new team members (and their managers) through the practical steps of integrating into the team's workflow and processes. This goes beyond technical setup to include introductions to key tools, understanding the team's sprint cycle, how to participate in ceremonies, and who to contact for different types of questions.
    * **Why it's useful:** They **streamline the assimilation of new talent** into the team's operational rhythm. They ensure that all essential process-related knowledge is covered, allowing new members to quickly understand the team's ways of working and become productive contributors without feeling lost.
