### 2.1. Relational Databases (SQL)

Relational databases store data in structured tables with predefined schemas, ensuring data integrity through relationships.

**Examples:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Amazon Aurora, AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL.

#### Advantages:
* **Data Consistency:** Enforce ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, crucial for transactional integrity.
* **Structured Data:** Ideal for highly structured data where relationships between entities are well-defined and critical.
* **Maturity & Ecosystem:** Long-standing technology with mature tools, extensive community support, and well-understood best practices.
* **Complex Queries:** Excellent for complex joins and analytical queries across multiple tables.

#### Disadvantages:
* **Scalability Challenges (Vertical):** Primarily scale vertically (more powerful server), which eventually hits limits and can be costly. Horizontal scaling (sharding) is complex to implement and manage.
* **Schema Rigidity:** Changing schemas can be difficult and require downtime for large datasets.
* **Performance Bottlenecks:** Can become a bottleneck for very high-volume, unstructured, or rapidly changing data.

#### Use Cases:
* **Transactional Applications:** E-commerce platforms, banking systems, CRM, ERP, and any application requiring strong data consistency.
* **Structured Data:** Storing customer information, orders, inventory, or financial records where relationships are key.
* **Reporting & Analytics:** When complex SQL queries and aggregations are frequently needed.
* **Existing Skillsets:** If your team has strong SQL and relational database administration expertise.

    * **Caching:** Session management, frequently accessed data, full-page caching.
    * **User Profiles/Preferences:** Simple lookups of user-specific data.
    * **Leaderboards/Counters:** Real-time updates for game scores or website counters.

#### 2.2.3. Wide-Column Stores

Store data in tables with rows and dynamic columns, optimized for large datasets and high write throughput.

**Examples:** Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Amazon DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB (Cassandra API).

* **Advantages:**
    * **Massive Scalability:** Designed for petabytes of data across distributed clusters.
    * **High Write Throughput:** Excellent for ingesting large volumes of data quickly.
    * **High Availability:** Often provide high availability with eventual consistency.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Complex Data Modeling:** Requires careful design for efficient queries.
    * **Eventual Consistency:** Data may not be immediately consistent across all nodes.
* **Use Cases:**
    * **Time-Series Data:** IoT sensor data, stock market data, monitoring data.
    * **Big Data Analytics:** Storing large operational datasets for analytical workloads.
    * **Messaging Systems:** For storing large volumes of messages.

#### 2.2.4. Graph Databases

Store data in nodes and edges, representing entities and their relationships, optimized for highly connected data.

**Examples:** Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, Azure Cosmos DB (Gremlin API).

* **Advantages:**
    * **Relationship-Oriented:** Excellent for navigating and querying complex relationships between data points.
    * **Intuitive Modeling:** Data model closely resembles real-world relationships.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Niche Use Cases:** Not suitable for all data types; best for interconnected data.
    * **Scalability Challenges:** Horizontal scaling can be more complex than other NoSQL types.
* **Use Cases:**
    * **Social Networks:** Friend connections, recommendations.
    * **Fraud Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns in transactions.
    * **Knowledge Graphs:** Representing complex interconnected data.
