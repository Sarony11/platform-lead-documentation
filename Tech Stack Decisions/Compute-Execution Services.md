# Compute / Execution Services: Decision Guide

This document outlines various compute and execution service options for deploying applications, detailing their advantages, disadvantages, and ideal use cases to aid in technology stack decision-making.

## 1. Virtual Machines (VMs) / Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Virtual Machines offer the highest level of control over the underlying operating system and software stack. Examples include AWS EC2, Azure VMs, and Google Compute Engine.

### Advantages:

* **Maximum Control:** Full root access to the OS, enabling highly customized environments, specific kernel versions, and support for legacy applications.
* **Flexibility:** Capable of running virtually any application, operating system, or software.
* **Familiarity:** Many development and operations teams are already proficient in managing VMs.
* **Persistent State:** Easier to manage stateful applications and utilize local storage directly.

### Disadvantages:

* **High Operational Overhead:** Responsibility for OS patching, security updates, scaling (manual or via complex Auto Scaling Groups), and hardware provisioning falls on your team.
* **Less Efficient Resource Utilization:** VMs often include overhead for the guest OS, potentially leading to wasted resources.
* **Slower Deployment:** Boot times are typically longer compared to containerized or serverless alternatives.

### Use Cases:

* **Legacy Applications:** Ideal for migrating older applications that demand specific OS versions, configurations, or direct hardware access.
* **Customization Needs:** When an application requires very specific kernel configurations, unusual software, or specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs).
* **High Control Requirements:** For workloads where granular control over every layer of the stack is paramount.
* **Cost Predictability:** For stable, long-running workloads, reserved instances can offer a predictable cost structure.

## 2. Container Orchestration Platforms (Kubernetes, ECS)

These platforms (e.g., AWS EKS/ECS, Azure AKS, Google GKE) automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications (e.g., Docker).

### Advantages:

* **Portability:** Containers encapsulate applications and dependencies, ensuring high portability across diverse environments (development, test, production, on-premise, cloud).
* **Efficiency:** More efficient resource utilization than VMs, as multiple containers can run on a single host.
* **Scalability:** Include robust auto-scaling capabilities based on defined load metrics.
* **Microservices Friendly:** Perfectly suited for managing complex microservices architectures.
* **Faster Deployment:** Offer quicker startup times than VMs.

### Disadvantages:

* **Complexity:** Can have a steep learning curve and significant operational complexity, especially Kubernetes, requiring specialized skills for effective management.
* **Operational Overhead (Still Significant):** While abstracting some VM concerns, teams are still responsible for managing clusters, nodes, networking, and upgrades (though less so with managed services like EKS).
* **Stateful Challenges:** Managing persistent storage and stateful applications within containers can be more intricate than on VMs.

### Use Cases:

* **Microservices Architectures:** Optimal for applications composed of many small, independent services.
* **DevOps Culture:** Suitable for teams with a mature DevOps methodology and robust CI/CD pipelines.
* **High Scalability & Resiliency:** When applications demand rapid scaling and high availability under fluctuating loads.
* **Multi-Cloud Strategy:** If portability across different cloud providers or hybrid environments is a core strategic requirement (Kubernetes excels in this area).

## 3. Serverless Functions / Function as a Service (FaaS)

Serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) execute code in response to events, completely abstracting away server management.

### Advantages:

* **Zero Server Management:** The cloud provider fully manages all underlying infrastructure. Developers only provide the application code.
* **Automatic Scaling:** Functions scale automatically to handle traffic spikes, even scaling down to zero when not in use.
* **Pay-per-Execution:** Costs are incurred only for the compute time consumed when the function is actively running, leading to significant savings for intermittent workloads.
* **Faster Time-to-Market:** Developers can focus exclusively on business logic, accelerating the development cycle.

### Disadvantages:

* **Cold Starts:** Functions may experience initial latency on the first invocation after a period of inactivity.
* **Execution Limits:** Typically subject to limits on execution duration, memory allocation, and package size.
* **Debugging Challenges:** Debugging distributed serverless applications can introduce additional complexity.
* **Vendor Lock-in:** Code can become tightly coupled with specific cloud provider services and APIs.
* **State Management:** Generally not ideal for long-running stateful processes.

### Use Cases:

* **Event-Driven Workloads:** Perfect for responding to API requests, database changes, file uploads, stream processing, or scheduled tasks.
* **Intermittent Workloads:** Applications with unpredictable or infrequent traffic patterns.
* **Cost Optimization:** Particularly cost-effective for workloads where compute time is short and sporadic.
* **Simplified Operations:** When minimizing operational overhead and infrastructure management is a primary goal.

## 4. Platform as a Service (PaaS) / Container as a Service (CaaS)

PaaS offerings (e.g., AWS App Runner, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps, Heroku) abstract infrastructure concerns, allowing direct code deployment. CaaS specifically focuses on containerized applications within a PaaS-like model.

### Advantages:

* **High Developer Productivity:** Developers can concentrate solely on application code, as the platform manages infrastructure, scaling, and deployments.
* **Simplicity:** Easier to deploy and manage compared to VMs or even full Kubernetes clusters.
* **Built-in Scaling & Load Balancing:** Automatic scaling and traffic management are typically included features.
* **Reduced Operational Overhead:** Significantly less management burden than IaaS or self-managed container orchestration.

### Disadvantages:

* **Limited Customization:** Less control over the underlying OS, network, or specific software versions compared to VMs.
* **Vendor Lock-in (Varies):** While some CaaS (like Cloud Run) can run standard containers, integration with cloud-specific services can still lead to vendor lock-in.
* **Cost Predictability:** Can sometimes be less cost-predictable than VMs for consistent, high-volume workloads if not carefully managed.
* **Less Flexible for Complex Architectures:** Might not be suitable for highly complex microservices with intricate networking or specific sidecar requirements that a full Kubernetes environment offers.

### Use Cases:

* **Web Applications & APIs:** Ideal for modern web applications, APIs, and simple microservices that can run within a container or a standard runtime environment.
* **Teams Prioritizing Speed & Simplicity:** When rapid deployment and a minimal operational burden are critical priorities.
* **Smaller Teams/Startups:** Beneficial for teams with limited DevOps resources who wish to maximize focus on product development.
* **"Containerized Serverless" Need:** When the benefits of serverless (pay-per-use, auto-scaling to zero) are desired, but the application needs to run as a standard container.
